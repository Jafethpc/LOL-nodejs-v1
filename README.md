# LOL SearchTool v1

A node tool that grabs player data from RIOT APIs(League Of Legends) and displays it.

This project is a version 1 and a first attempt at using NodeJs, ExpressJs, and View Engine templates.

# How will the logic work?

1. Someone will input a name of a player.

2. You will be redirected to a page displaying some player information.

3. The player information that was searched will be stored in a JSON file.

4. There will be an update button on the page displaying player data, this will update the old data and add on the new data.

###### Note

Due to this being my first NodeJs project, it contains many lines of comments that provides me a great way to understand the concept of what everything does.
